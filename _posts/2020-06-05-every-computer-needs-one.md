This clickbait has seen variations across the web.  It tries to entice the reader by showing
some weird pictures of computers, like a laptop with a plastic cover.  Variants include:

<table style="width:260px">
<tr>
  <td><img width="240px" src="{{site.baseurl}}/content/everycomputer/every-computer-owner-needs.jpg" alt="Don't Click, Every Computer Owner"></td>
</tr>
<tr style="background-color:white">
  <td><b>Every Computer Owner Needs One Of These Today</b></td>
</tr>
</table>

<table style="border:0px">
<tr>
 <td><img width="140px" src="{{site.baseurl}}/content/everycomputer/every-computer-to-stay-safe.jpg" alt="Don't Click, Every Computer Owner"></td>
 <td><b>Every Computer Owner Should Have One Of These To Stay Safe Online</b></td>
